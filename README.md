# Remarkable-projects:

## Predicting Stock Close Prices :
predicting stock Close price using LSTM model on approximately a Million examples.
* StockPricePrediction.ipyn : the code of the project.
* NewDataEntire.csv : dataset after preparing.
* my_model_1 : weights of the model after the first epoch.
* my_model_3 : weights of the model after the third epoch.

## Running Distance Accuracy Challenge (UHEgypt_challege):
Quantify the diï¬€erences between two distance measurement sources with real life dataset that are used for a run tracking app work is to build a model that can minimize the gaps between distance values across the track to achieve a similar total track distance from both sources. The model will learn the distance calculation mechanism from the benchmark source to be able to correct distance values from the other source.

* project.ipyn : the code of the project.
* train_sequences.zip : train independent columns.
* test_sequences.zip : independent columns.
* train_targets.zip : train dependant columns.
* train_tracks.zip : the track data of the trainingset.
* additional_targets.zip , additional_sequences.zip :additional data.
